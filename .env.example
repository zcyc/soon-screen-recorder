# DEVELOPMENT NOTES
# ==================================================
# 1. Server-side variables (NEXT_APPWRITE_*) are used by:
#    - lib/appwrite-server.ts
#    - Server Actions and API routes
#    - Admin operations requiring API key
#
# 2. Client-side variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) are used by:
#    - Client components that need direct Appwrite access
#    - Currently most functionality uses server-side approach
#
# 3. Both sets may be needed for full functionality, but server-side
#    variables are mandatory for core features
#
# 4. Never commit real API keys to version control
# 5. Use .env.local for local development (not tracked by git)
